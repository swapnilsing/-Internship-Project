SmogSense 🌍💨

SmogSense is an "Environmental monitoring and pollution control project" developed as part of my internship.  
The goal of this project is to "track, analyze, and visualize air quality parameters" to better understand pollution levels and suggest preventive measures.

✨ Key Features
- 📊 Real-time monitoring of environmental data (air quality, pollutants, weather factors)  
- 📈 Data visualization through interactive charts and dashboards  
- 🧹 Pollution trend analysis and pattern detection  
- ⚙️ Modular codebase  with reproducible Jupyter notebooks  
- 📦 Easy setup using `requirements.txt`  

🎯 Objective
SmogSense aims to **assist in environmental awareness and pollution control** by providing actionable insights from sensor data and datasets.  
The project demonstrates how technology and data science can be applied to **combat air pollution and promote sustainable living**.

📂 Datasets

The datasets used in SmogSense were sourced from Kaggle.

They include air quality and environmental monitoring data containing features such as:
🌫️ Concentration of pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, CO, O₃)
🌡️ Meteorological factors (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure)
📍 Location and time-based readings for trend analysis

These datasets serve as the foundation for:
1)Data preprocessing and cleaning
2)Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3)Visualization of pollution patterns
4)Predictive modeling for air quality monitoring
